# News Week Home Website From 2019

## Description.

This project is a clone from [newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com), the instructions are base on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/using-bootstrap, lastly I used Flexbox to build the Navbars and promo boxes).

For this project I used [Bootstrap framework](https://getboostrap.com/), which helps you to build responsive design.
